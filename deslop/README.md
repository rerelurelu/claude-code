# deslop

Remove AI-generated "slop" from code changes in the current branch.

## Overview

This plugin helps maintain code quality by identifying and removing unnecessary additions that AI assistants sometimes introduce, ensuring code remains consistent with the project's existing style and practices.

## Installation

```
/plugin marketplace add rerelurelu/claude-code
/plugin install deslop@rerelurelu/claude-code
```

## Usage

The skill is automatically invoked by Claude when needed, or you can manually invoke it:

```
/deslop
```

## What it removes

- Extra comments that a human wouldn't add or are inconsistent with the rest of the file
- Extra defensive checks or try/catch blocks that are abnormal for that area of the codebase (especially if called by trusted/validated codepaths)
- Any other style that is inconsistent with the file

## How it works

1. Check the diff against the main branch
2. Analyze changes for AI-generated patterns
3. Remove unnecessary additions
4. Provide a brief 1-3 sentence summary of what was changed

## Allowed Tools

This skill uses the following tools:
- Read
- Edit
- Write
- Bash
- Grep
- Glob
- Task
